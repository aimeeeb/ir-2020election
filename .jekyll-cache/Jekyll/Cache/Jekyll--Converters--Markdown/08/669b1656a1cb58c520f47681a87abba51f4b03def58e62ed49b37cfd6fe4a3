I"î<p>As the current president and the Republican candidate for the 2020 election, President Trump‚Äôs actions are incredibly important in dealing with the issue of foreign interference. In the 2016 election, it was found that Russia‚Äôs interference assisted Trump‚Äôs election by spreading damaging information about his competitor, Hillary Clinton. Going into another presidential election, Trump now has more say in how to handle the threat of foreign interference.</p>

<h3 id="trumps-actions-and-view">Trump‚Äôs Actions and View</h3>

<p>Trump continually denies any foreign interference in U.S. elections. He believes that claims of foreign involvement are spread by Democrats to attack him and as a way to put into question the legitimacy of his candidacy. He believes he has taken action to discourage other countries and so foreign interference is no longer a threat. In addition to this, he has stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Russian government hasn‚Äôt meddled and Trump believes him.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>Besides his statements regarding foreign interference, Trump has also taken action in response to foreign interference. Intelligence officials gave a briefing to the House of Representatives about foreign efforts to interfere. Trump appeared unhappy with the briefing as he believed Democrats would use the information to further attack him. Afterwards, the director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire was removed and replaced with Richard Grenell, who was a well-known supporter of Trump. It is believed that this decision was made because of what happened at the briefing.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>Trump has also urged foreign governments to look into Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. This was one of the main topic‚Äôs in the president‚Äôs impeachment hearings. Trump had asked for the governments of Ukraine and China to look into the Biden‚Äôs alleged wrong doings and he has said that he would accept information received by foreign actors.<sup>4</sup></p>

<h3 id="realism-in-trumps-actions">Realism in Trump‚Äôs Actions</h3>

<p>The president‚Äôs actions may seem confusing. It is often difficult to understand a person‚Äôs actions on the surface but his choices may be described by realism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Realism</strong>. Theory that views the nation state as a single actor and focuses on actions that benefit the state. It believes states living in a context of anarchy so all states can only rely on themselves. There is the idea of ‚Äúbalance of power‚Äù where war brings down any state that becomes too powerful, expressing the need for alliances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Realists actions are rationalized based on the benefit to the state. In Trump‚Äôs case, his goal in realist thinking would be to focus on anything that gives more power and success to the United States and fight against whatever would harm the country. For the 2020 election, Trump appears to dismiss the threat of foreign interference and instead act in ways to undermine Biden‚Äôs campaign. Based on realism, Trump may view Biden as a greater threat to the wellbeing of the United States than the meddling of foreign state actors.</p>

<p>Considering the ‚Äúbalance of power‚Äù concept in realism, the United States needs flexible alliances in case any one state grows too powerful. Trump may be wary of retaliating against the countries interfering because they could be potential allies if the need for war arises.</p>

<p>However, his actions aren‚Äôt very realist. Trump appears to be looking at many individuals within states, such as Biden and Putin, while realism views nation-states as a single entity. In addition, foreign interference can do harm to the U.S., so his actions don‚Äôt seem to be focused on bring more power to the state he represents. A different theory may explain his actions more.</p>

<h3 id="constructivism-in-trumps-actions">Constructivism in Trump‚Äôs Actions</h3>

<p>Realism and Liberalism are the dominant schools of thought in international relations but alternative theories can better explain certain actions. Constructivism focuses on socially constructs and international norms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Constructivism.</strong> Theory that the world is socially constructed. Meaning is given to things from the structure around it and states act based on social norms and their identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the United States, a focal point of any election are the differing views of Republicans and Democrats. Bipartisanship is a social construct that greatly influences Trump‚Äôs actions. He identifies as a Republican and social norms expect that he acts in ways that benefit his party. Rather than acting against foreign interference, Trump responds to the Democrats involved in the situation. For example, his effort to urge foreign governments to look into Biden is motivated by the fact that Biden was most likely to be his running competitor in the 2020 election. By undermining Biden‚Äôs campaign, he gives the Republican party a better chance at winning the presidency.</p>

<p>In addition to being a Republican, Trump has an identity assigned by his supporters that dictate how he should act. Republican Senator Ron Johnson has said in response to Trump‚Äôs statements in this situation that it is just, ‚ÄúTrump being Trump.‚Äù<sup>4</sup> His denial of foreign interference and his claim that this is intended to attack him connect with how society expects him to act.</p>

<p>With Trumps Constructivist approach, his focus is on the Republican party and the priorities of his constituents. As a result, foreign interference in the election is not as great of a threat as the competition with Democrats.</p>
