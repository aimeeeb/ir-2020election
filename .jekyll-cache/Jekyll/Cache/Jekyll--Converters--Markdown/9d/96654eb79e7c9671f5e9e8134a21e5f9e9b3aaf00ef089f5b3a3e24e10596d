I"Ã<p>The 2020 election is at risk because of efforts by foreign state actors to promote disinformation in the United States. Unfortunately, this is not the only countries threatened by foreign interference. Throughout the world and throughout the years, there are elections. This means that foreign interference is an issue that effects people around the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Liberalism.</strong> A theory with a focus on protecting the life, liberty, property of individuals. Importance of democracy, cooperation, and international norms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The liberalist focus is to promote the rights of individuals and to encourage democracy. Because foreign interference threatens democracy and citizensâ€™ rights to accurate information, liberalism places a greater focus on the issue, as opposed to <a href="http://localhost:4000/trump">Trumpâ€™s Constructivist outlook</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to taking the problem seriously, liberalism encourages cooperation. Foreign interference is a global issue and liberalist would encourage states to share information and work together on counterintelligence efforts. This would benefit the most people, instead of just protecting U.S. citizens.</p>
