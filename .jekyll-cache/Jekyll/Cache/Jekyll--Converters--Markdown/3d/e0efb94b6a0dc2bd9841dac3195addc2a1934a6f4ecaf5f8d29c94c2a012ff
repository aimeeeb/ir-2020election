<p>Foreign Interference in the 2020 Election
Intelligence officials found that state actors from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are involved in efforts to meddle in the 2020 Election
The goal is to spread disinformation to influence the thoughts of Americans
Considered to have been a consistent issue especially since 2016
Use social media, sympathetic spokespersons, media, ‚Äúfalse-flag operations‚Äù, hacking (3, 4)
Russia
main goal is to sow chaos (2)
undermine American confidence in election systems
China
financing certain US media outlets 
main focus is to promote economic standing (13, 4)
Why is foreign meddling an issue
self determination of nation states - the people within a state determine the government
states should not be involved in sovereign decisions within a different state</p>
