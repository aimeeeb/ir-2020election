I"Å<p>As the current president and the Republican candidate for the 2020 election, President Trump‚Äôs actions are incredibly important in dealing with the issue of foreign interference. In the 2016 election, it was found that Russia‚Äôs interference assisted Trump‚Äôs election by spreading damaging information about his competitor, Hillary Clinton. Going into another presidential election, Trump now has more say in how to handle the threat of foreign interference.</p>

<h3 id="trumps-actions-and-view">Trump‚Äôs Actions and View</h3>

<p>Trump continually denies any foreign interference in U.S. elections. He believes that claims of foreign involvement are spread by Democrats to attack him and as a way to put into question the legitimacy of his candidacy. He believes he has taken action to discourage other countries and so foreign interference is no longer a threat. In addition to this, he has stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Russian government hasn‚Äôt meddled and Trump believes him.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>Besides his statements regarding foreign interference, Trump has also taken action in response to foreign interference. Intelligence officials gave a briefing to the House of Representatives about foreign efforts to interfere. Trump appeared unhappy with the briefing as he believed Democrats would use the information to further attack him. Afterwards, the director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire was removed and replaced with Richard Grenell, who was a well-known supporter of Trump. It is believed that this decision was made because of what happened at the briefing.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>Trump has also urged foreign governments to look into Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. This was one of the main topic‚Äôs in the president‚Äôs impeachment hearings. Trump had asked for the governments of Ukraine and China to look into the Biden‚Äôs alleged wrong doings and he has said that he would accept information received by foreign actors.</p>

<h3 id="realism-in-trumps-actions">Realism in Trump‚Äôs Actions</h3>

<p>The president‚Äôs actions may seem confusing. It is often difficult to understand a person‚Äôs actions on the surface but his choices may be described by realism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Realism</strong>. Theory that views the nation state as a single actor and focuses on actions that benefit the state. It believes states living in a context of anarchy so all states can only rely on themselves. There is the idea of ‚Äúbalance of power‚Äù where war brings down any state that becomes too powerful, expressing the need for alliances.</p>
