Social media has also played a role in information spreading more quickly, especially with the rhetoric of the term "hacking" in connection to U.S. elections.<sup>7</sup> Both Twitter and Facebook have found and shut down thousands of accounts from countries such as Russia, Iran, and China.<sup>8, 11</sup>

### Identity Politics

Facebook discovered and shut down fake Instagram accounts by foreign state actors that represented themselves as Americans. These accounts represented themselves as black activists, feminists, LGBTQ, pro- or anti-Trump, and environmentalists.<sup>11</sup> People around the world use their identity to fit into groups with people similar to them. With the freedom to choose their own media, most will follow individuals who share their identity. By impersonating specific groups, foreign state actors made it more likely that their messages would be spread to U.S. citizens.

### Actions by Twitter and Facebook

Both Twitter and Facebook have been involved in combating foreign interference campaigns for elections around the world since 2016 and have more resources going into the 2020 U.S. election. To combat the spread of disinformation and foreign propaganda, they have improved the ability to identify inauthentic behavior, such as spam and fake accounts.<sup>8</sup> Facebook created the "War Room," a additional team focused on identifying foreign interference.<sup>15</sup> Along with identifying and removing foreign accounts, Facebook has greater transparency for the origin of groups and clearly labels posts from state-owned media. To prepare for elections, Twitter and Facebook have met directly with presidential campaigns.<sup>15</sup>

### Liberalism in Social Media Platform's Actions

Twitter and Facebook have made efforts to protect its users and elections. Their actions mainly reflect a liberalist point of view.

> **Liberalism.** A theory with a focus on protecting the life, liberty, property of individuals. Importance of democracy, cooperation, and international norms.

By taking action to protect elections, Twitter and Facebook show a focus on protecting individuals. Social media platforms are how many people consume news and combatting fraudulent accounts and posts upholds the rights that people have to accurate information. Their actions are also liberalist because of the value they place on democracy.

In addition to protecting individuals, Twitter and Facebook cooperate with other actors and other states, which is encouraged in liberalism. Both companies are based in the U.S. but have coordinated with other countries to protect elections around the world. They have also collaborated with teams other than their own by meeting with presidential campaigns. The willingness to work with others for the sake of individuals shows the platform's liberalist stance.
