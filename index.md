At times, countries may meddle in the affairs of other parts of the world. This becomes more prominent during times of elections, such as the United States Presidential election, where the outcome of the event will have an effect on the rest of the world for years. Recently, this has become an even greater risk with the rise of technology. Increased use of digital avenues for voting and campaigning as well as the presence of social media has put more attention on cybersecurity.

### Foreign Interference in the 2020 United States Election

Intelligence officials have warned of election interference efforts by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Countries have meddled in the United States election in the past and it is believed to have been a continuous issue, especially since 2016. This means that United States actors have been battling interference from foreign state actors all throughout the year for at least the past four years, even outside of election time.

The main goal of these efforts is to spread disinformation. These efforts seem to prefer certain candidates, distorting the stances of their competitors.<sup>5</sup> It is believed that Russia aims to sow chaos and undermine the confidence that Americans have in the election system.<sup>5</sup> China, on the other hand, is focused on promoting their own economic standing.<sup>13</sup>
