        <p>Past events influences the current actions of actors. In 2018, the midterm elections were said to have had foreign interference as well and intelligence officials called it a “dress rehearsal” for 2020.<sup>3</sup> The presidential in 2016 brought attention all around the world to how foreign interference can affect an election and showed a need for greater counterintelligence efforts.</p>

<h3 id="foreign-interference-in-the-2016-us-election">Foreign Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election</h3>

<p>In 2016, it was suspected that Russia had government orders to meddle in the election. Follow the election, a nearly two year investigation led by Robert Mueller found that a number of Russian state actors had interfered. These actors had hacked databases of Democratic National Committee and spread damaging information regarding Hillary Clinton on WikiHow. They also hacked some state voter rolls and pushed misinformation about Clinton on social media. Although it was found that President Trump did not collude with Russia, it does seem that this interference could have swayed the results of the election.<sup>9</sup></p>

<h3 id="differences-in-2020">Differences in 2020</h3>

<p>One difference between 2016 and 2020 is awareness about the possibility of foreign interference. The government and counterintelligence agencies are on greater alert regarding threats from foreign actors. Along with this, the issues surrounding the 2016 election were given a massive amount of media attention, leading to greater awareness of the issue in the average citizen. Because more  are aware that interference often comes in the form of social media posts, in 2020 U.S. may be more wary of what they believe or share.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Technology has also progressed in the 4 years since Trump was elected. Deep fake technology, software that allows a person’s facade to realistic appear on a video, has grown more sophisticated and may assist in the spread of false narratives.<sup>11</sup></p>

<h3 id="the-effect-of-a-pandemic-covid-110">The Effect of a Pandemic: COVID-110</h3>

<p>The rise of COVID-110 as a pandemic has resulted in a lot of changes around the world. The main changes are lockdown measures and social distancing efforts. This has resulted in more communication via digital means, including campaigning. This increases the cybersecurity risk.<sup>13</sup> More information is online that can be hacked into and more people are spending time with technology, increasing their risk of being exposed to false narratives on social media.</p>
