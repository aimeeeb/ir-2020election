        <p>At times, countries may meddle in the affairs of other parts of the world. This becomes more prominent during times of elections, such as the United States Presidential election, where the outcome of the event will have an effect on the rest of the world for years. Recently, this has become an even greater risk with the rise of technology. Increased use of digital avenues for voting and campaigning as well as the presence of social media has put more attention on cybersecurity.</p>

<h3 id="foreign-interference-in-the-2020-united-states-election">Foreign Interference in the 2020 United States Election</h3>

<p>Intelligence officials have warned of election interference efforts by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Countries have meddled in the United States election in the past and it is believed to have been a continuous issue, especially since 2016. This means that United States actors have been battling interference from foreign state actors all throughout the year for at least the past four years, even outside of election time.</p>

<p>The main goal of these efforts is to spread disinformation. These efforts seem to prefer certain candidates, distorting the stances of their competitors.<sup>6</sup> It is believed that Russia aims to sow chaos and undermine the confidence that Americans have in the election system.<sup>6</sup> China, on the other hand, is focused on promoting their own economic standing.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p>There are a variety of methods used by foreign state actors to push their agendas. Using social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, they create fake accounts to spread information that highlight on divisive topics.<sup>4</sup> The governments also utilize “media, false-flag operations, or sympathetic spokespersons,” according to intelligence officials. The Chinese government finances media outlets that influence the point of view of United States citizens in China’s favor.<sup>9</sup> Overall, the goal of these operations is to sway public opinion repeatedly sharing information using outlets that U.S. citizens regularly consume. In addition to these, some efforts may be involved in hacking into systems to get information on candidates or change the numbers at voting stations. Because of the resources needed to successfully into systems such as voter registrations systems, this is not as great of a concern as the spread of fraudulent information.<sup>9</sup></p>

<h3 id="why-is-this-an-issue">Why is this an Issue?</h3>

<p>The United States is a nation-state separate from these other countries. This grants them sovereignty and as a democratic state the people within the country exercise self-determination.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Nation-state.</strong> a political community in which the state claims legitimacy on the grounds that it represents all citizens, including those who may identify as a separate community or nation</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sovereignty.</strong> a state has control and authority over its own territory and being free from any higher legal authority</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Self determination.</strong> the idea that a group of people in a discrete area should be able to govern themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States elections, especially the presidential election, is the structure in place to allow citizens to act on these rights. By interfering on individual’s rights to properly assess the election, these foreign state actors are impeding on the United States’ sovereignty.</p>
